# Detecting Cyber Security Threats from Short Noisy Texts
<ul>
<li> Used Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to build a model that can identify cyber security events from Tweets. </li> 
  <li>The neural model utilizes meta-embeddings learned from domain-specific word embeddings and task-specific features to capture maximum contextual information as tweets are short and noisy. </li> 
    <li>Also employed a two channel architecture that combined both LSTM and CNN. Used meta-embeddings for feature learning via LSTM and CNN, and their feature maps are concatenated with contextual embeddings in the Fusion Layer.</li> 
  </ul>
